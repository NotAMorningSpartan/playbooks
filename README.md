# Ansible Playbook Collection
This is a collection of all the Ansible playbooks I use in my personal lab. 

## Requirements

Since I primarily use Red Hat Enterprise Linux in my home environment (with a couple exceptions), all playbooks in this project were built using Ansible 2.9. Compatibility with later versions of Ansible is probable but not guaranteed. 

## Dependencies

-  None

## Usage

Please see the README.md located in each folder for specific usage instructions for each set of repositories (To be added). 

## License

None.
